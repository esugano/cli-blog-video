<h1>CLI Gem Data Project Tips</h1>

<p>If you're anything like me, you're probably terrified of starting the CLI Data Gem project. Your palms get sweaty, your mind is racing, and you're basically memorizing Avi's CLI Walkthrough video. Let me attempt to help you out with some basic tips:</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Picking a Website That is Easy To Scrape <br>
Before starting out, I would poke around different sites to find one that has clean and organized code. If you‚Äôre not sure, ask someone (see advice #4).

<li>Throw Out Advice #1 if You‚Äôre Absolutely Passionate About Your Chosen Website <br>
With that said, the website I chose to scrape was a NIGHTMARE. However, I decided to use this project to contribute to my side hustle. It took me (way) longer than normal but I didn‚Äôt want to give up or pick a new site because I really (like really) want to scrape that data! In the end, your passion and your hustle will take you to the finish line even if the website contains iframes, dynamic URLs, and headaches for days. </li>

<li>Start Small <br>
You know how people like to say ‚ÄúGo big or go home‚Äù? Yea, that doesn‚Äôt apply here. It is much easier to start small and grow from there instead of attempting something big, creating something that is messy or doesn‚Äôt work, and wasting time. Not that I have any personal experience with this...<br></li>

<li>Find & Get Help<br>
If you‚Äôre scared that you‚Äôre limited to only four project 1:1s, don‚Äôt be. There is plenty of help out there.
* Study Groups - Study groups happen about twice a week. The section lead goes over a sample project, other students show theirs, and you get to ask specific questions. This is a really great resource.
* Section Lead 1:1 These are unlimited! Schedule in advice, come prepare with questions, and get them answered in 15 minutes! The section lead also shares a lot of other relevant info too. Take advantage, y‚Äôall.
* Project 1:1s I haven‚Äôt tested this but word on the Flatiron street is that no one is policing the four sessions limit. I also doubt they‚Äôll stop you from having a 5th Project 1:1 if you‚Äôre really stuck.  </li>

<li>View Other Student Repos <br>
See how others are coding their projects. Here is a sample demo from one of the study groups I attended: https://github.com/cjbrock/worlds-best-restaurants-cli-gem </li>

<li>Git Commit Basics & Best Practices <br>
You‚Äôll be graded on your commits so check out these references to help you out: <br>

<li>Join the Slack Channel <br>
I found out too late that there‚Äôs a #CLI-data-gem-project channel. There is lots of good info, very helpful people, and it sure is nice to know other people feel your pain!</li>

<li>When you‚Äôre feeling despair, listen to ol‚Äô skool Beyonce and read Michelle Obama quotes <br>

 I'm a survivor (what?)
 I'm not gon' give up (what?)
 I'm not gon' stop (what?)
 I'm gon' work harder (what?)<br>
Technically Destiny's Child but pretty much Beyonce lyrics<br>


 Just try new things. Don't be afraid. Step out of your comfort zones and soar, all right?<br>
